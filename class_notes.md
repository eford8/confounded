# Notes taken in class

## 2019-01-22

Next week:

- Have the structure of your paper written out
- Write Methods section completely
  - Don't wander around, just tell the reader what is important to the hypothesis
  - This is a place for subtle oddities in your work (a fish died so it wasn't balanced, or whatever)
  - Come up with subsections, each should probably have a few paragraphs

When he reviews our papers, Jerry will look for how the ideas in our methods relate to our hypothesis.

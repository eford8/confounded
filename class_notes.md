# Notes taken in class

## 2019-01-22

Next week:

- Have the structure of your paper written out
- Write Methods section completely
  - Don't wander around, just tell the reader what is important to the hypothesis
  - This is a place for subtle oddities in your work (a fish died so it wasn't balanced, or whatever)
  - Come up with subsections, each should probably have a few paragraphs

When he reviews our papers, Jerry will look for how the ideas in our methods relate to our hypothesis.

Four paragraphs in an introduction

1. Hook / funnel - about 2 steps away from the main point
2. Talk about all the awesome stuff that's been done (noble failure at the end)
3. "To address this question, what we need is...", then brief description of study system & how it can be used to address the noble failure, lead up to next paragraph
4. Introduce the hypothesis or hypotheses: "In this study, we address this question by addressing the following hypotheses."

Could be fewer or more paragraphs, but this ^ generally works well.

There should probably be about 10-15 citations within the introduction.

Make sure to transition between paragraphs.

**Think about the title this week.**

Don't come on Thursday.

### Purpose of the discussion

What do I think matters most about my work?

Tell the reader the 4 things that I think are most important about my work. These should deliver to the people that are targeted in your funnel in the intro.

We'll then keep the 3 most important things. *Don't* talk about every single implication / everything that comes to mind. These 3 things should be roughly equally weighty.

**This week**:

- Find 3 papers I love & figure out why
- Bring the 4 most important implications

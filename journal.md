Just met with Dr. Piccolo. He wants me to come to our meeting next week with a list of everything that needs to be done by the end of the semester and when I want to have it done. Probably the next thing he'll want from me is to have a specific plan and specific days to have each thing done. And then a description of what I want to have done each day. And then a daily update. Should be good!

He also asked me to write down some things that I've tried lately and whether or not they worked & why. Here are a few.

- The DMResnet has been pretty much impossible to get working. Evan spent a semester working on it, and I spent about 20 hours working on it over the break, and the code just won't work for our application, presumably because:
  - It requires that there are only two batches (pretty much every dataset, e.g. bladderbatch, has more than two)
  - It requires that the two batches are perfectly balanced

Didn't finish writing the last entry. I need to get this stuff into a Git repo... One sec...

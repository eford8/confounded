# Removing batch effects with domain adversarial networks

## Abstract

## Background

`[Explanation of what's been done in batch adjusting so far]`.
However, most batch correction software to this point has only adjusted for linear batch effects.
A few notable examples use deep neural networks to correct for batch effects, but these are optimized for use in large, balanced, dual-batched datasets and are therefore unusable for many real-world examples.
